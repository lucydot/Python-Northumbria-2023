Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the checklist for students on the Northumbria Physics course! This checklist can be used to monitor your progress through core Python topics.

If this is your first visit, you will need to get setup. Please see the student instructions [here](https://lucydot.github.io/ChooChoo/students/setup/). Ask me (Lucy) or another member of staff for support if you are stuck.
